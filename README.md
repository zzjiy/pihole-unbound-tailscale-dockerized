Why this stack
🧭 Privacy by design: This stack keeps DNS resolution private within your own network. You control the data path and can prevent leaks to external resolvers.

🧰 Modularity: Pi-hole handles ad blocking, Unbound provides recursive DNS with strong privacy, and Tailscale gives you a secure VPN to reach your home network from anywhere.

🚀 Dockerized deployment: The entire stack runs inside containers. Docker Compose makes it easy to spin up, manage, and re-create the environment.

🔒 Secure by default: DNS queries can be encrypted end-to-end via Tailscale when you’re connected, and you can tune firewall rules to minimize exposure.

What’s in this project
- Pi-hole as the DNS-based ad blocker and web management portal
- Unbound as a modern, open recursive resolver with DNSSEC
- Tailscale as a VPN/mesh network for secure remote access
- Docker Compose as the orchestration layer
- Environment-driven configuration for easy customization
- Scripts and templates to simplify deployment across hosts

How the pieces fit together
- The Pi-hole container serves as the DNS frontend. It answers queries for clients connected to the network and enforces ad-block rules.
- The Unbound container acts as the recursive resolver. It fetches DNS records on behalf of Pi-hole and validates responses with DNSSEC.
- The Tailscale container (or sidecar) creates a private network tunnel. Devices on your Tailscale network can resolve the private DNS without exposing queries to the public internet.
- Docker Compose ties everything together. It wires networks, volumes, and environment variables so you can deploy with a single command.

Quickstart: deploy with Docker Compose
Prerequisites
- A Linux host or compatible environment with Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Sufficient resources: 1–2 CPUs, 1–2 GB RAM per container, plus storage for DNS data and logs
- A stable network: a management network for the stack and a separate network for clients if you want strict segmentation

Step-by-step quickstart
1) Create a project directory
- mkdir -p ~/dns-stack/pihole-unbound-tailscale
- cd ~/dns-stack/pihole-unbound-tailscale

2) Prepare your environment
- Copy the sample environment file and adjust values as needed
- cp .env.sample .env
- Edit .env to set:
  - PIHOLE_WEBPASSWORD or alternative auth
  - UNBOUND_ROOT_HINTS to point to a valid root hints file
  - TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY if you plan to enroll devices automatically

3) Bring up the stack
- Run docker-compose up -d
- Wait a few moments for containers to start
- Check container logs if needed: docker-compose logs -f

4) Verify DNS resolution
- Point a client to the Pi-hole container’s IP for DNS (e.g., 192.168.1.2)
- Visit the Pi-hole admin interface at http://<pi-hole-ip>/admin
- Confirm that ad blocks are active and that Unbound is resolving queries

5) Connect clients with Tailscale
- Install the Tailscale client on devices you want to connect
- Authenticate to your Tailnet
- Use the private DNS domain you configured to direct queries through the stack
- Ensure clients are using the Tailscale DNS or the Pi-hole DNS for consistent results

6) Tune and customize
- Update the blocklists in Pi-hole
- Enable DNSSEC validation in Unbound
- Adjust Tailscale ACLs and routes to narrow access

Prerequisites and environment planning
- Choose a host with enough CPU and memory to satisfy the load you expect
- Plan DNS forwarders and fallback behavior in Unbound
- Decide whether you want to allow split-horizon DNS (different responses based on the client network)
- Decide on how you want to handle ad-block lists and allowlists

- Networking considerations
  - Your Pi-hole container will expose port 53 (DNS) and port 80 (Web UI) to your chosen networks
  - Unbound will be the DNS resolver that Pi-hole uses upstream
  - Tailscale will provide a secure tunnel for remote devices to access the DNS service
  - You may choose to expose DNS to your LAN and keep VPN DNS for remote devices behind the Tailscale tunnel

Architectural diagrams and visual guidance
- The stack is a small graph of components that communicates via DNS ports and VPN tunnels
- You can think of it as:
  - Clients -> Pi-hole (DNS front-end)
  - Pi-hole -> Unbound (recursive resolver)
  - Clients via Tailscale -> DNS service (encrypted path and secure remote access)

- Inline ASCII diagram:
  Clients (LAN) -> Pi-hole -> Unbound
  Tailscale VPN links remote clients to Pi-hole and Unbound
  End-to-end encryption for DNS queries when using Tailscale

- If you prefer a visual diagram, you can render an architecture diagram using your preferred diagram tool with these components and connections in mind.

Docker Compose file explained
- The docker-compose.yaml coordinates three main services:
  - pihole: The Pi-hole container that serves the DNS and web UI
  - unbound: The Unbound container that performs recursive DNS queries
  - tailscale: The Tailscale client connection (may be an agent or a sidecar) that provides secure remote access

- Core configuration aspects:
  - networks: A dedicated Docker network to ensure containers can talk to each other
  - volumes: Local storage for persistent data such as DNS caches, logs, and configuration
  - environment: Variables to tune Pi-hole and Unbound, such as DNSSEC, admin password, and DNS servers
  - ports: Expose only the necessary ports to the intended network

- Behavior you can expect:
  - Pi-hole serves the UI and ad-blocked DNS answers
  - Unbound resolves queries on behalf of Pi-hole with DNSSEC validation
  - Tailscale enables devices outside your LAN to reach the DNS services securely

Customization and advanced options
- Blocklists and allowlists
  - Add custom ad-block lists to Pi-hole
  - Create per-domain exceptions if you need to support certain services
  - Keep lists updated to maintain performance and accuracy

- DNSSEC and security
  - Enable DNSSEC validation in Unbound
  - Regularly update root hints and trust anchors
  - Consider TLS for DNS transport if you extend to DoT/DoH later

- Tailscale integration
  - Use Tailscale ACLs to control which devices can query the DNS service
  - Route DNS queries through the Tailscale network for private addressing
  - Consider multi-hop or exit node configurations if your privacy goals require them

- Data persistence and backups
  - Persist Pi-hole and Unbound data to local volumes
  - Schedule regular backups of configuration and DNS data
  - Rotate logs to prevent disk space exhaustion

- Performance tuning
  - Increase Unbound cache size for faster lookups
  - Fine-tune Pi-hole blocking rules to balance ad-block reach with site functionality
  - Monitor system load and scale resources if you run a large number of clients

Tailscale configuration and remote access
- Enrolling devices
  - Install the Tailscale client on devices you want to connect
  - Authenticate with your Tailnet
  - Ensure the devices have the DNS you configured in your stack
- DNS over Tailnet
  - When connected to Tailnet, devices can resolve via the private DNS path
  - You can configure the DNS to point to the Pi-hole service endpoint for a private, encrypted path
- ACLs and access control
  - Use Tailscale ACLs to restrict who can query the DNS service
  - Define a private DNS zone for Tailnet devices if needed
- Disaster recovery and offline scenarios
  - Keep a fallback DNS path for devices that aren’t connected via Tailnet
  - Document steps to quickly switch to a LAN-only DNS path if the Tailnet is unavailable

DNS behavior and privacy considerations
- Privacy posture
  - DNS queries are directed to a local Pi-hole instance, with upstream queries going to Unbound
  - When connected to Tailscale, queries can be encrypted and routed through the private network
- Logging and data retention
  - Decide what logs you want to retain
  - Consider anonymizing or reducing logging to improve privacy
  - Keep logs for troubleshooting but rotate and delete old data

- Ad-blocking effects
  - Pi-hole blocks many ad domains, reducing tracking
  - Some sites rely on ads for functionality, so you may need to adjust blocklists or whitelist certain domains
- DNS performance
  - Unbound caches queries to speed up responses
  - Tailscale adds a secure tunnel; ensure the network path is healthy to avoid latency spikes

Networking and firewall guidance
- LAN-side protections
  - Restrict DNS traffic to your Pi-hole and Unbound containers
  - Use a firewall to block external DNS ports unrelated to your stack
- VPN-side protections
  - Ensure VPN clients route DNS queries through the VPN
  - Consider splitting DNS traffic so private queries stay on the private network
- NAT considerations
  - If your host provides NAT, ensure the correct DNS forwarding is in place
  - Map port 53 and 80 in a secure way to your Pi-hole if you are exposing a UI for LAN-only access
- High availability
  - You can run multiple instances in a high-availability scenario
  - Use a load balancer between clients and Pi-hole if you plan large-scale usage

Monitoring, logging, and health checks
- Health checks
  - Ensure the Pi-hole DNS service is reachable
  - Confirm Unbound is resolving queries correctly
  - Verify Tailscale connectivity remains active for remote clients
- Logs
  - Monitor DNS queries and responses
  - Track blocked domain counts for insight into ad-block effectiveness
  - Turn on verbose logs during troubleshooting, then reduce to normal levels
- Metrics
  - Collect metrics for DNS performance, cache hit rate, and latency
  - Use container-level metrics to observe resource usage
  - Consider exporting metrics to a monitoring system for long-term visibility

Data persistence and backups
- Volumes
  - Use persistent volumes for Pi-hole catalog data, DNS cache, and blocklists
  - Persist Unbound configuration and cache data
  - Persist Tailscale state if you use a persistent key or keyring
- Backups
  - Schedule backups of critical data regularly
  - Include: blocklists, whitelist/blacklist configurations, Unbound root hints, and Tailscale configurations
- Recovery procedures
  - Document the steps to recreate the environment from a backup
  - Test restoration periodically to ensure reliability

Troubleshooting common issues
- DNS resolution failures
  - Check if Pi-hole is running and reachable
  - Confirm Unbound is resolving queries and that Pi-hole is configured to use Unbound as upstream
  - Validate that the DNS port is not blocked by a firewall
- Web UI access issues
  - Verify the Pi-hole admin password or authentication method
  - Check that port 80 (or your chosen UI port) is accessible on the LAN
- Tailscale connectivity problems
  - Ensure the Tailnet is healthy and devices are authenticated
  - Confirm ACLs allow DNS queries from remote devices
  - Verify the DNS server address used by the remote devices is the private DNS endpoint
- Blocklist updates
  - If ad-blocking stops working, check for changes in blocklist formats or remote fetch failures
  - Ensure the blocklists are synchronized with Pi-hole and updated regularly

Maintenance and upgrades
- Keeping components up to date
  - Regularly pull the latest container images
  - Review release notes for breaking changes or migration steps
  - Test upgrades in a staging environment before production
- Configuration drift
